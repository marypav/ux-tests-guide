# FAQs

Got questions about UX testing? Don’t worry—we’ve got answers. Whether you’re new to the game or a seasoned pro looking for clarity, this FAQ section is here to tackle your burning questions with wit and wisdom. Let’s dive in!  

---

### **1. What’s the difference between moderated and non-moderated testing?**  
- **Moderated Testing:** A facilitator guides participants in real-time, answering questions and probing for insights. Think of it as UX testing with a personal trainer.  
- **Non-Moderated Testing:** Participants complete tasks on their own without a facilitator. It’s like setting users free in the wild and watching what happens.  
*Pro Tip:* Use moderated for deep dives and non-moderated for quick, scalable insights.  

---

### **2. How many participants do I need for a UX test?**  
The golden rule is **5 to 8 participants** per user group for usability tests. This small sample size is enough to uncover 80% of usability issues.  
*Translation:* Quality over quantity. You don’t need a crowd to spot patterns.  

---

### **3. How do I choose the right participants?**  
Recruit users who reflect your target audience. Consider demographics, behaviors, and use cases.  
*Example:* Testing a budgeting app? Look for users who actively track expenses.  
*Pro Tip:* Avoid testing with your colleagues—they know your product too well to give unbiased feedback.

### **4. What’s the best tool for UX testing?**  
It depends on your goals:  
- Need fast, unmoderated tests? Try **Maze**.  
- Want in-depth moderated sessions? Go with **Lookback**.  
- Need robust user session tracking? **Hotjar** has you covered.  
*Pro Tip:* Pick a tool that fits your test type, and don’t be afraid to mix and match.  

---

### **5. How do I write good test tasks?**  
Keep them clear, realistic, and actionable.  
- Avoid: *“Test the navigation.”*  
- Use: *“Find the company’s return policy on the website.”*  
*Pro Tip:* Frame tasks as real-world scenarios to engage participants naturally.  

---

### **6. What’s the difference between usability testing and A/B testing?**  
- **Usability Testing:** Evaluates how users interact with your product to uncover pain points and improve workflows.  
- **A/B Testing:** Compares two versions of a design to see which one performs better.  
*Think:* Usability testing improves the *experience*, while A/B testing finds the *winner.*  

---

### **7. How do I analyze UX test results?**  
- Organize your data: Group feedback by themes (e.g., navigation, usability).  
- Spot patterns: Look for recurring pain points or user behaviors.  
- Prioritize findings: Focus on high-impact issues first.  
*Pro Tip:* Use visuals like heatmaps and graphs to bring your insights to life.  

---

### **8. How often should I conduct UX testing?**  
Test **early and often.**  
- During ideation: Validate concepts.  
- Before launch: Spot critical usability issues.  
- Post-launch: Fine-tune based on real-world use.  
*Pro Tip:* UX testing isn’t a one-and-done—it’s a continuous process.  

---

### **9. Do I need to test prototypes, or can I just test the final product?**  
Always test prototypes. It’s cheaper, faster, and easier to fix issues before you’ve committed to code.  
*Pro Tip:* Even a rough wireframe can reveal valuable insights. Don’t wait for perfection.  

---

### **10. What if my test reveals more problems than solutions?**  
That’s a win! Spotting issues means you’re catching them before your users do.  
*Pro Tip:* Break findings into manageable steps, prioritize fixes, and test again. It’s all part of the UX journey.
