# Writing Test Tasks

Test tasks are the heartbeat of a UX test—they direct participants' actions and reveal how effectively your product supports their goals. Well-written tasks provide clarity, focus, and actionable insights. This section will teach you how to craft tasks that guide participants while letting their natural behavior shine.

### What Are Test Tasks?

Test tasks are specific activities participants are asked to complete during a UX test. They align with your test objectives and simulate real-world interactions, offering a window into how users navigate and use your product.

Example:
*"Find the nearest ATM using the mobile app."*

### Principles of Writing Effective Test Tasks

1. **Align Tasks with Objectives**
Each task should directly address one of your test objectives. For instance, if you’re testing navigation, a task might involve finding a specific feature or piece of information.
2. **Keep Tasks Clear and Concise**
Use simple, straightforward language. Avoid jargon, long-winded instructions, or ambiguity that might confuse participants.
Example: 
Instead of: *"Navigate to the financial services section and explore loan options to simulate an inquiry."*
Use: *"Find information about available loan options."*
3. **Use Real-World Scenarios**
Frame tasks as relatable situations to help participants engage naturally. This adds context and ensures their behavior reflects real-life usage.
Example: *"You’ve misplaced your card. Use the app to report it and request a replacement."*
4. **Be Unbiased**
Avoid leading participants to specific actions or outcomes. Instead, let them discover their own paths to complete the task.
Biased: *"Click the top-right search icon to find customer support."*
Unbiased: *"Find a way to contact customer support."*
5. **Define Goals, Not Steps**
Focus on what participants need to accomplish, not how they should do it. This approach highlights usability strengths and weaknesses.
Example:
*"Find out how to change your email address in your account settings."*
6. **Make Tasks Specific and Measurable**
Tasks should have clear success criteria so you can evaluate whether participants achieve the desired outcome.
Example:
*"Find and add a pair of sneakers to your shopping cart."*

### Best Practices for Writing Tasks

- **Limit Complexity**: Avoid overwhelming participants by breaking down large processes into smaller, manageable tasks.
- **Test Your Tasks**: Pilot your tasks with a few users to ensure clarity and feasibility.
- **Consider Different Devices**: If your product spans multiple platforms, tailor tasks to reflect device-specific experiences.

### Examples of Effective Test Tasks

1. *"You want to cancel your subscription. Use the website to complete this action."*
2. *"You’re planning a dinner party and need a recipe for pasta. Use the app to find one."*
3. *"You’ve received a refund and want to check its status. Find this information in your account."*
