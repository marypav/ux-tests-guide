# UX Report Structure

A killer UX report isn’t just a data dump—it’s a well-structured narrative that transforms raw findings into a compelling story. Think of it as your chance to shine, delivering insights that grab attention, drive decisions, and (let’s be real) make you look like the UX rockstar you are.

Here’s how to structure your report so it’s as sharp as your research skills.

1. **Executive Summary**  
*What It Is:* A TL;DR for busy stakeholders.  
*What to Include:*  
   *  The test objectives.
   *  Key findings (spoiler: the ones that really matter).
   *  High-level recommendations.
        Example: *"Participants struggled to find the checkout button, leading to a 40% task failure rate. A clearer button label and placement could increase conversions significantly."*
Pro Tip: This is your hook—make it snappy, clear, and impossible to ignore.

2. **Objectives and Scope**  
*What It Is*: The “why” behind your research.  
*What to Include:*
     *  Test goals (e.g., "Evaluate the usability of the new checkout flow").
     *  What you tested and what you didn’t (set those boundaries).
        Example: *"This study focused on navigation usability in the mobile app but excluded advanced search features."*
Pro Tip: Lay the groundwork, so no one asks, “Why didn’t we test X?” halfway through the meeting.

3. **Methodology**  
*What It Is:* The “how” that backs up your findings.  
*What to Include:*
     *  Participant demographics.
     *  Test tasks and scenarios.
     *  Tools and platforms used.
        Example: *"10 participants, aged 25–45, completed three tasks using the mobile app. We used UserTesting.com to record sessions and collect feedback."*
Pro Tip: Keep it concise—this isn’t a research paper.

4. **Key Findings**  
*What It Is:* The juicy part of the report.  
*What to Include:*
     *  Top usability issues and successes.
     *  Patterns in user behavior.
     *  Supporting metrics (completion rates, error frequencies, etc.).
        Example: *"70% of participants couldn’t locate the ‘Track Order’ feature, with many commenting it felt ‘hidden.’"*
Pro Tip: Pair findings with visuals—because no one remembers a wall of text.

5. **Recommendations**  
*What It Is:* The action plan.  
*What to Include:*
     *  Clear, prioritized fixes for each key finding.
     *  Impact and effort estimates.
        Example: *"Revise the 'Track Order' label to ‘Order Status’ and move it to the main menu. Estimated effort: Low. Impact: High."*
Pro Tip: Make it actionable. “Fix navigation” isn’t helpful.

6. **Visualizations and Supporting Data**  
*What It Is:* The proof behind the points.  
*What to Include:*
     *  Charts, graphs, heatmaps, and screenshots.
     *  User quotes for qualitative gold.
        Example: *"Heatmap analysis shows a 10% click rate on the 'Track Order' link, significantly lower than the 30% expected."*
Pro Tip: Keep it clean and uncluttered—this is where data meets design.

7. **Appendix**  
*What It Is:* The “in case you’re curious” section.  
*What to Include:*
     *  Full participant demographics.
     *  Detailed task descriptions.
     *  Raw data or links to recordings.
        Example: *"Appendix A: Participant Profiles. Appendix B: Task Instructions."*
Pro Tip: Include enough to back up your findings, but don’t overwhelm—your appendix shouldn’t feel like a novel.

**Why It Works**
This structure ensures your report is clear, compelling, and actionable. You’re not just presenting data—you’re telling a story that drives real change. With this approach, your findings won’t just be heard; they’ll be acted upon. Because let’s face it, a great report is as much about the delivery as it is about the data.
