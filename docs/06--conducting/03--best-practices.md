# Best Practices

Running a UX test is more than following a script—it’s about creating an environment where participants feel comfortable and your team gathers meaningful insights. Whether you’re conducting moderated or non-moderated tests, these best practices will help you get the most out of your efforts.

1. **Set the Tone**
      * **Be Warm and Welcoming**: Make participants feel at ease from the start. A friendly introduction reduces nerves and encourages authentic behavior.
      * **Avoid Bias**: Remind participants there are no right or wrong answers, and you’re testing the product—not their skills.
2. **Provide Clear Instructions**
      * **Reiterate Goals**: Briefly explain what participants will be doing and why, without giving too much detail that might influence their actions.
      * **Explain the Process**: Let them know how long the test will take, what tasks they’ll complete, and whether their actions will be recorded.
3. **Stay Neutral (For Moderated Tests)**
      * **Listen More Than You Talk**: Resist the urge to guide or assist participants unless absolutely necessary.
      * **Encourage Thinking Aloud**: Prompt users to share their thoughts as they navigate but avoid leading questions. Example: "What’s going through your mind as you try this?"
4. **Handle Technical Issues Gracefully**
      * **Have a Backup Plan**: Be prepared for technical glitches, such as a non-responsive interface or recording software issues.
      * **Stay Calm**: Reassure participants if something goes wrong and quickly resolve the issue without derailing the session.
5. **Observe and Document Carefully**
      * **Watch for Behaviors**: Pay attention to hesitation, confusion, or repeated actions—these often signal usability issues.
      * **Take Notes**: Record key moments, patterns, and user quotes. These can complement video recordings and save time during analysis.
6. **Limit Interference (For Non-Moderated Tests)**
      * **Craft Clear Tasks**: Ensure participants know what to do without requiring additional guidance.
      * **Provide Technical Support in Advance**: Include FAQs or support contact details to address potential issues without direct intervention.
7. **Respect Participant Feedback**
      * **Be Open-Minded**: Remember that every piece of feedback, even critical comments, is valuable for improvement.
      * **Avoid Defensiveness**: If a participant struggles with a feature, don’t justify or explain—it’s a signal to improve the design.
8. **End on a Positive Note**
      * **Thank Participants**: Show appreciation for their time and effort.
      * **Offer a Chance for Final Feedback**: Ask, "Is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience?"
9. **Follow Up Quickly**
      * **Save and Backup Data Immediately**: Ensure recordings, notes, and other data are securely stored.
      * **Review Initial Findings**: Debrief with your team right after the test while observations are fresh.
10. **Iterate and Improve**
      * **Test Iteratively**: Use insights from each round to refine your design and test again.
      * **Stay Flexible**: Adapt your approach based on what you learn, both from participants and your testing process.
