# Instructions for Participants

Clear, concise instructions set the stage for a successful UX test. They guide participants through the test process, ensuring they understand what’s expected of them and feel confident as they engage with your product. This section covers how to craft instructions that foster ease and focus without biasing user behavior.

### Why Instructions Matter
- **Set Expectations**: Help participants understand their role and what they need to do.
- **Reduce Confusion**: Minimize questions or misinterpretations during the test.
- **Encourage Honest Feedback**: Emphasize that there are no “right” or “wrong” actions to ease performance anxiety.

### What to Include in Participant Instructions
1. **Test Purpose (High-Level Overview)**
    * Provide a brief explanation of the test’s purpose without revealing too much detail that might influence behavior.
    * Example: *"We’re testing how people use this app to complete common tasks."*
2. **What Participants Should Do**
    * Clearly explain the process: completing tasks, answering questions, and sharing feedback.
    * Example: *"We’ll ask you to perform a few tasks and then answer some questions about your experience."*
3. **Encourage Authentic Behavior**
    * Reinforce that you’re interested in their honest actions and feedback.
    * Example: *"Please navigate the app as you normally would—there are no right or wrong answers."*
4. **What to Expect Technically**
    * Outline any technical steps, like screen sharing or recording, to ensure participants are prepared.
    * Example: *"Your screen activity will be recorded, but we won’t capture any personal information."*
5. **How to Handle Uncertainty**
    * Let participants know it’s okay to express confusion or ask questions if they’re unsure about something.
    * Example: *"If you’re unsure about what to do, just say so and describe what you’re thinking."*
6. **Time Commitment**
    * Provide an estimate of how long the test will take.
    * Example: *"This session will take about 20–30 minutes to complete."*

### Example Instructions
*"Welcome, and thank you for participating in our test! We’re looking to understand how people use our product to complete everyday tasks. We’ll ask you to perform a series of tasks and answer some questions along the way.*

*Please interact with the product as you naturally would. There’s no right or wrong way to do this—we’re just interested in your thoughts and actions. If you’re unsure about something, feel free to share what’s on your mind.*

*This test should take about 20 minutes, and your screen activity will be recorded for analysis. If you encounter any technical issues, let us know immediately. Thank you for your time and valuable feedback!"*

### Tips for Writing Effective Instructions
- **Be Friendly and Welcoming**: Create a relaxed tone to put participants at ease.
- **Avoid Bias**: Don’t hint at what the “correct” actions or answers might be.
- **Test Your Instructions**: Pilot them with a small group to ensure clarity and completeness.
