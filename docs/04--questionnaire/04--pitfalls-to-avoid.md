# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Creating effective UX test questionnaires can be tricky, and even small missteps can compromise the quality of your data. To ensure you get meaningful and actionable insights, watch out for these common pitfalls:

1. **Leading Questions**
Questions that suggest a specific answer can bias participants and skew your results.
    * Example of a leading question: *"How much do you love this feature?"*
    * Better approach: *"What are your thoughts on this feature?"*
2. **Double-Barreled Questions**
These combine two separate questions into one, making it unclear which part the participant is answering.
    * Example: *"Was the interface easy to use and visually appealing?"*
    * Better approach:
      "How easy was the interface to use?"
      "How visually appealing did you find the interface?"
3. **Overloading the Questionnaire**
Too many questions can overwhelm participants, leading to rushed or incomplete responses.
    * Solution: Focus on the most important questions and keep the questionnaire concise. Aim for quality over quantity.
4. **Ambiguous Wording**
Unclear or complex language can confuse participants and result in unreliable data.
    * Example of ambiguous wording: *"How intuitive was the interface for completing your goal?"*
    * Better approach: *"Was it easy to complete your task?"*
5. **Inconsistent Scales**
Using different scales for similar questions can confuse participants and complicate data analysis.
    * Solution: Stick to a consistent scale format (e.g., 1–5 or 1–10) throughout your questionnaire.
6. **Asking Hypothetical Questions**
Participants often struggle to predict their future behavior accurately.
    * Example of a hypothetical question: *"How often would you use this feature?"*
    * Better approach: *"Did you feel this feature was useful?"*
7. **Neglecting Open-Ended Questions**
While scales and multiple-choice questions are efficient, failing to include open-ended questions can limit the depth of insights.
    * Solution: "Do you have any other feedback?"
8. **Failing to Pilot Test the Questionnaire**
Unreviewed questionnaires may include unclear or irrelevant questions.
    * Solution: Test your questionnaire on a small group to identify and address any issues before deployment.
