# Process Testing (e.g., user flows)

User flows are the journeys your users take to achieve their goals within your product. From onboarding to checkout, these processes should feel intuitive, efficient, and frustration-free. Process testing evaluates these flows step by step, ensuring every interaction aligns with user expectations.

### Why Test User Flows?
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Pinpoint where users get stuck or abandon tasks.
- **Optimize Efficiency**: Ensure flows are as streamlined and logical as possible.
- **Enhance Usability**: Verify that users can complete tasks with minimal friction.
- **Validate Changes**: Test updates to ensure they improve the user journey.

### What to Test in User Flows
1. **Completeness**
      * Can users finish the process without missing critical steps?
2. **Clarity**
      * Are the steps easy to understand?
      * Is it clear what users need to do next at each stage?
3. **Efficiency** 
      * How quickly can users complete the flow?
      * Are there unnecessary steps that could be removed?
4. **Error Handling**
      * Are error messages helpful and actionable?
      * Can users recover easily from mistakes?
5. **User Satisfaction** 
      * Do users feel confident and accomplished after completing the flow?

### Example Processes to Test
- *"Sign up for a new account using the website."*
- *"Complete a purchase, from adding an item to the cart to receiving confirmation."*
- *"Submit a support ticket through the mobile app."*
- *"Update your billing information in your account settings."*

### What to Look For During Testing
- **Completion Rates**: How many users successfully complete the process?
- **Time on Task**: How long does it take to finish?
- **Confusion Points**: Where do users hesitate or seem unsure?
- **Error Frequency**: How often do users encounter errors, and how do they handle them?
- **Overall Flow Satisfaction**: Do users feel the process is smooth or cumbersome?

### Tips for Improving User Flows
- **Map Out Steps**: Visualize the flow from start to finish to identify unnecessary complexity.
- **Provide Guidance**: Use clear labels, progress indicators, and tooltips to guide users.
- **Test Iteratively**: Regularly test updates to ensure continuous improvement.
- **Analyze Drop-Offs**: Review analytics to identify stages where users abandon the flow.
