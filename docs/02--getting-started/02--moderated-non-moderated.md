# Moderated vs. Non-Moderated

When it comes to UX testing, you’ve got two main options: moderated and non-moderated. Both are powerful tools, but like a hammer versus a screwdriver, each has its time and place. Let’s break them down so you can wield the right one with confidence.

## Moderated UX Testing

Moderated testing is like having a guide on a hiking trail—you’re there in real-time to observe, assist, and dig deeper into the participant’s thoughts as they navigate your product.

**How it works:**
A facilitator (you, or another UX professional) works one-on-one with a participant, guiding them through tasks, answering clarifying questions, and probing for insights.

**Best for:**
Early-stage designs that need hands-on explanation or exploration.
Complex workflows where context is key.
Situations where detailed verbal feedback is critical.

**Pros:**
- You can ask follow-up questions on the spot.
- Rich qualitative data from real-time interactions.
- Immediate troubleshooting for any issues.

**Cons:**
- Time-consuming and resource-intensive.
- Requires skilled facilitators to avoid bias.
- Small sample sizes due to logistical constraints.

## Non-Moderated UX Testing
Non-moderated testing is the set-it-and-forget-it option. Participants complete tasks on their own, at their own pace, without a facilitator hovering nearby. Think of it as letting users explore your product in their natural habitat.

**How it works:**
Participants receive a set of instructions or tasks to complete within a testing platform. Their interactions, feedback, and screen recordings are collected for analysis afterward.

**Best for:**
Quick, large-scale feedback from diverse participants.
Testing straightforward tasks or interfaces.
Identifying high-level usability trends and issues.

**Pros:**
- Scales easily—test with dozens or even hundreds of users.
- Cost-effective and faster turnaround.
- Captures authentic, unprompted user behavior.

**Cons:**
- Limited ability to ask follow-up questions.
- Requires precise task instructions to avoid ambiguity.
- Participants might abandon tasks if they get stuck.

## When to Use Which?

- **Go Moderated** when you’re looking for depth: exploratory research, complex workflows, or in-depth qualitative insights.
- **Go Non-Moderated** when you need breadth: validating usability across large user groups or running comparative interface tests.

Here’s the best part: these methods aren’t rivals; they’re teammates. Combine them strategically to get the richest, most actionable insights possible. The key is knowing when to call the shots in real-time and when to sit back and let users show you their true behavior.
