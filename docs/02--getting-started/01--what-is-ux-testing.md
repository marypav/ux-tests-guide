# What is UX testing?

UX testing, short for User Experience testing, is the process of evaluating a product or service by observing real users as they interact with it. The goal is simple yet critical: uncover how people experience your design—what delights them, what frustrates them, and, most importantly, what prevents them from achieving their goals.

Unlike hypothetical brainstorming sessions or internal reviews, UX testing grounds your product in reality. It captures raw, unfiltered feedback that reveals usability issues, uncovers unmet needs, and highlights opportunities for improvement. In short, it’s your cheat code for creating designs that people actually love to use.

## The Building Blocks of UX Testing
At its core, UX testing revolves around three key components:

1. **Real Users**
The people who actually use your product—not your design team, not your stakeholders, and definitely not your well-intentioned assumptions.

2. **Tasks or Scenarios**
Carefully designed activities that mimic real-world use cases, allowing you to observe whether users can navigate your product effectively and efficiently.

3. **Observation and Analysis**
Watching how users interact with your product, identifying patterns in their behavior, and drawing actionable insights from their experiences.

## Why Is UX Testing Essential?
Because no matter how brilliant your design seems on paper, users will always find a way to interact with it differently than you expect. UX testing helps you:

- Identify usability issues before they become costly problems.
- Validate design decisions with data instead of assumptions.
- Ensure your product meets user needs and expectations.
- Build trust and loyalty by creating experiences that feel intuitive and seamless.
