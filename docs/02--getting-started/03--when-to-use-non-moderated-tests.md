# When to Use Non-Moderated Tests

Non-moderated UX tests are the workhorses of user research: efficient, scalable, and ideal for capturing authentic user behavior. But they’re not a one-size-fits-all solution. Knowing when to deploy this method is key to maximizing its value.

## When Non-Moderated Testing Shines

1. **When Speed and Scale Matter**
Need insights yesterday? Non-moderated testing allows you to gather feedback from dozens (or even hundreds) of participants in a fraction of the time it takes to coordinate moderated sessions. It’s perfect for quick iterations in fast-paced product cycles.

2. **When You Want Unfiltered, Real-World Behavior**
Non-moderated tests let users interact with your product on their own terms, without a facilitator’s presence to influence their actions. This raw, unprompted feedback often reveals issues you’d never spot in a controlled setting.

3. **When Testing Straightforward Tasks**
If your focus is on basic usability—like checking if users can complete a form, navigate a menu, or find specific information—non-moderated tests are a no-brainer. They work especially well for tasks that don’t require much explanation or setup.

4. **When Comparing Designs**
Got two (or more) interface options and want to know which resonates more with users? Non-moderated comparative tests are ideal for collecting broad feedback quickly, giving you clear direction without the need for detailed probing.

5. **When Budget is Tight**
Running moderated tests can be resource-heavy, requiring skilled facilitators, dedicated time slots, and participant coordination. Non-moderated tests cut these costs significantly, making them a cost-effective choice for lean teams.


## When to Think Twice About Non-Moderated Tests

Non-moderated testing isn’t a silver bullet. Skip it if:

- You’re exploring **early-stage designs** that need live explanation or feedback.
- The task involves **complex workflows** that require user coaching.
- You need **in-depth qualitative insights** from participants.

Non-moderated UX tests are the go-to solution for validating usability, scaling feedback, and uncovering trends efficiently. Use them when the stakes call for speed, simplicity, and scale—but don’t hesitate to bring in moderated methods when depth and nuance are required.

Non-moderated isn’t just a backup plan—it’s a power move when wielded strategically.
